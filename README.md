# Medieval Castle Generator
3D print-ready medieval castle generator

### Generators are live on Thingiverse

[Grand Castle Generator](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1682427)
Combination of perimiter wall + recursive towers + simple controls


[Castle Generator](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1612651)
Recursive towers over a central building+towers


[Fortress Generator](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1639567)
Perimiter wall with towers and one generation of turrets




Ideas for future versions:
- Village generator
- Ground generator by combining several hills
- Add more themes, e.g. Taj Mahal, Winterfell
- Add outer decorative elements still in the 45deg slope logic: bridges, arches, etc.
- Holes for flags + seperate printing of flags
